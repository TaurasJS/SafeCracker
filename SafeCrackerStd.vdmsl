definitions 

--@doc R1 represent the safe cracker generally (e.g. N wheels and M spokes) 
--@doc R1.1 instantiate the safe cracker to specific configuration 
--@doc R1.2 instantiate the wheels (4) and spokes (16) 

--@doc R2 find the safe combination/configuration to open the safe
--@doc R3 ensure that at least one combination exists
--@doc R4 capture the safe properties in your design
--@doc R5 ensure that the safe development is satisfiable

--@doc suggested configuration with certain openning combination
--	   this also suggests a fixed notion of spokes (i.e. where is 1st spoke)?

--	   certain wheels have overlays over intermitent spokes
